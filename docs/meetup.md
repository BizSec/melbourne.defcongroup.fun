# Welcome to DEF CON Group Melbourne 

The next meetup will be:

IN PERSON

## Where and when?

There will be an _informal_ DEF CON Group Melbourne meetup on **Wednesday the 15th of October 2025**

We will meet on the steps of the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC) aka Jeff's Shed. 

## Nice one but there are a lot of steps at the MCEC. 

Sure. These will be the ones BEHIND the Polly Woodside - which is the very spiky looking **yacht**. (Subject to change - see next question)

## What if the weather is not great?

We will make a plan. Watch this space or better still join the Discord and watch that. 

## Do I need to book? 

No, this will be open to all. We kindly ask that you review the [DEF CON Code of Conduct](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-code-of-conduct.html)

## Do I need to be a hacker or in cybersecurity?

Well.. chances are you are already a hacker. But there are no requirements. 

# How much is it? 

$255 per person. No, kidding. It is free. We are just hanging out. If you want food then bring your own. 

## What time? 

We'll kick off at 7PM AEDT and stay until we are bored. We'll hang about for at least an hour. So, if you are late, don't worry. 

## How do I join?

The best way to get involved is to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/H8jCkw4) . But just come along. 

## Is this an official AISA / Cybercon meeting? 

Nope. We are not part of that. I just chose the venue and date because it means that peeps who are from out of town can join. Also, peeps who usually work from home may be around. 

## What should I bring? 

Excitement, respect, a good attitude. You can also bring gadgets and things if you think others may find them interesting to see or discuss. You can bring food or (non-alcoholic) drinks. 

## Is there a Code of Conduct? 

It'll be an informal meeting but we will still adhere to the [DEF CON Code of Conduct](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-code-of-conduct.html) so please review it. Attendance means that ou agree with it.
